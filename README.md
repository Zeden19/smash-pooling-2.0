Todo: 

- Use React router for getting requests, makes error handling and loading easier
- Edit Carpool (Status, origin, tournament)
- Set up carpool times, cost, description, auto status, seats remaining
- Set up a user store so we don't validate requests everywhere
- set up storage for driver images
- clean up api weirdness (stop overlying on route params)
- use search parameters for carpools pages
- use query to get car models (its super slow rn)
